## Usage -

  - If you want to create something, make a file with a .sh extension. For example, if you intend to use Jenkins, create a file named `` vim jenkins.sh``.
  - Next, copy the entire .sh code from the above file and paste it into the ```jenkins.sh``` file.
  - Then execute the script using this command: ```chmod +x ./jenkins.sh```.
  - The final and last step is to run the script command this: ```./jenkins.sh```.
  - Congratulations! Check your IP with port :8080. It will open Jenkins, and then enjoy.

  - **Repeat the process for any additional scripts or tasks you wish to execute.**
